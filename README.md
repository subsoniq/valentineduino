# valentineduino
Arduino pro mini 5v 16mhz + Realtimeclock module from sparkfun + 7 segment serial display + a cute enclosure = Valentineduino. Read everything on my blog. 

This is the raw code that also includes some other stuff, among others a temperature DS18B20 sensor, an LDR, and a RF module that sends out some values every 5 minutes. You can discard those things if you want. 

Sorry for not cleaning up the code further, you can use everything as you want, but please dont ask me any questions about the code as i am busy with other projects these days.
